## Overview

This World of Warcraft addon is the official companion for the WoW Efficiency website (`https://www.wowefficiency.com/`).

Its primary function is to automatically collect detailed information about your characters directly from the game. This includes:

*   **Profession Data:** Skill levels, knowledge points (spent and unspent), specialization progress, profession stats like Concentration, and cooldown tracking.
*   **Quest Completion:** Records of completed quests, used for task tracking.

This collected data is saved locally within your WoW SavedVariables (`WowEfficiency.lua`). The WoW Efficiency website can then utilize this data to provide comprehensive tracking, analysis, and efficiency tools for your characters.
